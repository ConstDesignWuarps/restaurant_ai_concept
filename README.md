# restaurant_ai_concept

A lightweight, open-architecture chatbot framework to power interactive restaurant websites using GitHub Pages and a minimal Flask backend. The goal is to offer a low-code, modular assistant system that supports everything from answering menu questions to enabling event bookings — with future integration into AI and data workflows.

---

## Vision

To empower restaurants to:
- Easily embed a smart assistant on their static sites (e.g., GitHub Pages)
- Handle FAQs, menus, and customer interactions with minimal setup
- Use Google form and data engines like collab to drive analytics alers and jobs
- Later expand into bookings, orders, events, and AI-powered data processing

All with a **minimal footprint**, leveraging **Flask as a secure API proxy**, and **OpenAI's LLMs** as the assistant engine.

## Architecture Overview
      +---------------------------+
      |   GitHub Pages (Frontend)|
      |  - Static HTML/JS        |
      |  - Embedded Chat Assistant|
      |  - Google Forms (Orders,  |
      |    Feedback, RSVP, etc.)  |
      +-----------+---------------+
                  |
                  ▼
      +---------------------------+
      | Flask Backend (API Proxy) |
      | - Securely calls OpenAI   |
      | - Manages route logic     |
      | - Future tool routing     |
      +-----------+---------------+
                  |
                  ▼
      +---------------------------+
      |    OpenAI GPT API         |
      |  - Restaurant-focused     |
      |  - Expandable with tools  |
      +-----------+---------------+
                  |
                  ▼
      +---------------------------+
      | Google Sheets / Colab /   |
      | NotebookML (Data Engine)  |
      | - Captures form responses |
      | - Runs analytics, alerts  |
      | - Prepares order data     |
      +---------------------------+

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: GitHub Pages (HTML/CSS/JS)
- **Backend**: Flask (minimal REST API for chat + routing)
- **AI Engine**: OpenAI GPT-3.5/4 via secure backend
- **Optional Extensions**:
  - Google Forms (for lead capture, feedback, RSVPs)
  - Google Sheets/Collab (for order data + analysis)
  - NotebookML / Jupyter (for later automation or ML workflows)

---

## Key Features

- **Embed Anywhere**: Add `<iframe>` widgets to any static or CMS-based page.
- **Domain-Focused AI**: Each assistant is context-tuned (e.g., restaurant, construction).
- **Agent-Ready Design**: Expandable routing pattern to add booking, FAQ, order agents.
- **Low-Code Friendly**: No full-stack dev required to update content, add tools, or adapt.

## Method Pattern

We use a **modular assistant pattern**:
1. Each assistant has its own route (`/restaurant/chat`, `/embed/restaurant`, etc.).
2. Context (system prompt) is injected per domain.
3. Agents or tools (bookings, menus, events) can be added via:
   - Function calling
   - Backend logic extension (tool dispatcher)
   - UI buttons/forms that tie into the chat or external data forms

Example routing logic:
```python
@app.route("/restaurant/chat", methods=["POST"])
def restaurant_chat():
    # Check intent or keyword → future: dispatch to tools
    # Respond using GPT
